## Data Science - Lab #7 - Data Cleanup Problems

#### Complete Handout #6

**Instructions**: Read the following problems. Using the pseudocode you wrote on the worksheet, write the code to implement these solutions. THEN, draft at least three test cases *USING A VARIETY OF INPUTS* for each method. Each of these should be written as functions that return a result and should include comments.



1. Given a first and last name as a String, split it into a separate first and last name variable with the first letter of each capitalized.

2. Given a double as a string with a $ at the front and potentially a comma somewhere in the string, return the value as a double without those characters present.

3. Given a first name, last name, and a domain (like cgps.org), return an email address that consists of the first initial, the full last name, an @ sign, and the domain.

4. Given a String with a distance measurement such as "5 ft" or "60 in", convert it into an integer value in meters that is rounded to the nearest whole meter.

5. Given an IP address that may have leading zeroes (such as 019.128.1.1), return the IP address with any leading zeroes removed.
